# QueryGenie.AI: Data Extraction from Database using AI

QueryGenie.AI is an AI-powered tool designed to facilitate data extraction from databases using natural language queries. Leveraging state-of-the-art language models and innovative technologies, QueryGenie.AI enables users to effortlessly retrieve desired data from databases without the need for expertise in SQL queries.

## Tools Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- MySQL
- Python
- Langchain
- Google Palm LLM
- Chroma DB vector database
- Few Shot Learning
- Prompt Engineering
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Overview
In this project, a large language model (LLM), specifically Google Palm LLM, is integrated with a database using Langchain, a technology that bridges natural language processing with database querying. The user interface (UI) allows users to input their queries in natural language. The LLM then converts these queries into SQL queries, which are executed to retrieve the relevant data from the database. Both the generated SQL query and the corresponding answer are displayed to the user.

## Use Case
The primary use case of QueryGenie.AI is to assist individuals or organizations that rely on databases for storing their data but lack expertise in writing SQL queries. This tool serves as a cost-effective alternative to hiring data analysts, as it empowers users to extract data using simple natural language queries. Whether it's a small retail store, a large online retailer, or any organization managing data, QueryGenie.AI streamlines the process of data retrieval, saving time and resources.
